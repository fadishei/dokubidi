DokuBidi: Bidirectional text plugin for [DokuWiki](http://dokuwiki.org/)
========

This plugin has two components:

* A syntax component which adds <code>&lt;ltr&gt;...&lt;/ltr&gt;</code> and
 <code>&lt;rtl&gt;...&lt;/rtl&gt;</code> tags to your wiki syntax.
* An action component which adds RTL and LTR buttons to your editor toolbar
  so you can easily insert the above markups in the text.

It's a good practice to let your site style match the direction of the text
which is dominant and use either RTL or LTR button to make exceptions to the
default direction. For example, for a wiki written mostly in persian, use an RTL
style and utilize LTR tags whenever you want to type English.
